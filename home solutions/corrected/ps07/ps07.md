## Summary of Key Corrections and Changes (Assignment 07)

1.  **DFT Length Adjustment (Task 2):**
    * Removed the unnecessary code block that forced the signal length `N` to be even before FFT calculation[cite: 30, 35]. Standard FFT indexing (`floor(N/2)`) correctly handles both odd and even lengths.

2.  **Elliptic Filter Design Call (Task 3):**
    * Modified the `ellip` function call to use the normalized passband edge frequency `Wp_norm` directly (`ellip(N_ord, Rp, Rs, Wp_norm)`)[cite: 54], instead of using the `Wn` output from `ellipord`[cite: 8]. While both might yield similar results for lowpass filters, using `Wp_norm` is arguably clearer and explicitly matches the passband edge requirement.

3.  **Missing Filter Response Plot (Task 4):**
    * Added the plot for the designed filter's magnitude response (`freqz`), which was required by Task 4 [cite: 78] but missing in the original user code. This includes calculating the response using `freqz(sos, ...)` and plotting it with appropriate labels and lines indicating passband/stopband specifications[cite: 79].

4.  **Signal Length Check (Task 5):**
    * Removed the superfluous check `if length(signal_filtered) ~= length(signal_normalized)` after applying the `sosfilt` function[cite: 91]. `sosfilt` should preserve the input signal length.

5.  **Time Vector Calculation (Task 5):**
    * Ensured the time vector `t` used for plotting is correctly based on the final length of the `signal_normalized` data (`N_final = length(signal_normalized); t = (0:N_final-1) / fs;`)[cite: 11].

6.  **Plotting Layout and Details (Task 2, 4, 5):**
    * Consolidated all plots (Raw Data, DFT, Filter Response, Filtered Data) into a single figure using a `subplot(2, 2, ...)` layout, similar to the reference solution[cite: 56], for better comparison.
    * Used the *calculated* `dc_bias` [cite: 96] for the `yline` on the filtered data plot[cite: 13], rather than a hardcoded value seen in the reference[cite: 60].
    * Adjusted y-limits on time-domain plots to be slightly dynamic (`ylim_amp`) to better fit the data range, rather than fixed values [cite: 109, 120] that might clip the signal.
    * Added an overall figure title using `sgtitle`[cite: 14, 56].

7.  **Code Clarity and Comments:**
    * Added `fprintf` statements to display key calculated values (peak frequency, filter order, corner frequencies, DC bias).
    * Included more detailed comments explaining the steps, corrections, and references to assignment requirements or solution approaches.
