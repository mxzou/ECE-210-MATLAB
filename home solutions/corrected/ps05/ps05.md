# What was wrong:

## Summary of Key Corrections and Changes

1.  **Vectorization (Problem 1 & 2):**
    * Replaced the `for` loop for calculating Fourier components and the sum with more efficient MATLAB vector operations (`a_n = (2 * n_indices + 1)'; s_components = sin(a_n .* t) ./ a_n; s_approx = sum(s_components, 1);`).
    * This improves performance and aligns with common MATLAB coding style.

2.  **Variable Reuse (Problem 2):**
    * Avoided recalculating the `s_components` in the second subplot.
    * The corrected code reuses the `s_components` matrix calculated in Problem 1, making the code more efficient.

3.  **Surface Calculation Error (Problem 3):**
    * Corrected the calculation of the surface `Z`.
    * The original code incorrectly used 1D vectors (`x`, `y`) instead of the 2D meshgrid matrices (`X`, `Y`).
    * The fix uses `Z = X .* sin(X) - Y .* cos(Y);` to evaluate the function correctly over the 2D grid.

4.  **Subplot Layout (Problem 2):**
    * Changed the subplot arrangement from `subplot(2, 1, ...)` (2 rows, 1 column) to `subplot(1, 2, ...)` (1 row, 2 columns).
    * This side-by-side layout (matching the solution key) often facilitates easier visual comparison between the approximation and its components.

5.  **Y-Axis Limits (Problem 1 & 2):**
    * Adjusted `ylim` from the original `[-1.5, 1.5]` to `[-1.2, 1.2]`.
    * The solution key used `[-1, 1]`, reflecting the theoretical range of the square wave. The chosen range `[-1.2, 1.2]` is a compromise, closer to the ideal range while still showing the overshoot caused by the Gibbs phenomenon.

6.  **Code Structure/Style:**
    * Added standard housekeeping commands (`clc; clear; close all;`) at the beginning.
    * Improved variable naming for clarity (e.g., `num_terms`, `s_components`, `s_approx`).
    * Incorporated comments to explain the code logic, corrections, and key steps.
