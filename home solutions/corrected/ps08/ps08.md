## Summary of Key Corrections and Changes (Assignment 08)

1.  **Symbolic Variable Declaration (Problem 2):**
    * Explicitly declared `R` and `C` as separate symbolic variables using `syms R C`.
    * The original code declared `RC` as one variable but then used `R` and `C` individually in the differential equation, which relies on implicit assumptions. Explicit declaration is better practice.

2.  **Symbolic Constant for VPA (Problem 3):**
    * Ensured the entire constant $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ was treated as a symbolic expression (`mu0_symbolic_constant = sym(4)*sym(pi)*sym(10)^(-7);`) before applying Variable-Precision Arithmetic (`vpa`).
    * The original code mixed numeric (`4`, `-7`) and symbolic (`sym(pi)`, `sym(10)`) parts within the `vpa` call. While potentially functional, making the constant fully symbolic first aligns better with the assignment hint and symbolic toolbox principles.

3.  **Code Structure and Clarity:**
    * Added standard housekeeping (`clc; clear; close all;`).
    * Used `fprintf` for more formatted output display.
    * Included comments explaining the purpose of the code sections and the minor corrections made.

*(Self-Correction during analysis: Initially considered the algebraic solution in Problem 1 might need the `solve` function for robustness, but recognized the user's direct calculation was correct and likely sufficient given the simplicity)*.
