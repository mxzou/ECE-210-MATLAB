## Summary of Key Corrections and Changes (Assignment 06)

1.  **Signal Amplitudes (Problem 2):**
    * Corrected the dB levels used for signal generation (`amplitudes_dB`) to match the assignment specification (`[14; -10; 0; 2]` dB) instead of the incorrect values used in the original code (`[0; -0.8; -2; -8]` dB). [cf. cite: 3, 55]

2.  **Signal Generation Method (Problem 2):**
    * Changed signal generation from using `A*cos(2*pi*f*t)` to using complex exponentials `A*exp(1j*2*pi*f*t)`. [cf. cite: 56]
    * This ensures each specified frequency `f` (including negative ones) corresponds to a single frequency component in the signal, aligning with the reference solution's approach and standard interpretation for single-sided spectra. [cf. cite: 23]

3.  **DFT Plotting (Problem 2):**
    * Incorporated `fftshift()` when calculating the DFT result (`S = fftshift(fft(signal_noisy))`) to center the spectrum around 0 Hz. [cf. cite: 10, 25]
    * Adjusted the frequency axis (`f_axis_shifted`) to correctly range from `-Fs/2` to `+Fs/2` corresponding to the `fftshift` output. [cf. cite: 24, 58]
    * This is standard practice for visualizing DFT results as shown in lecture/solution notes. [cf. cite: 24, 25]

4.  **DFT Normalization & dB Calculation (Problem 2):**
    * Removed the normalization by `N` when calculating the FFT (`S = fftshift(fft(signal_noisy))` instead of `X = fft(x_noisy)/N`). [cf. cite: 58]
    * Calculated dB magnitude (`S_dB = 20*log10(abs(S))`) based on the unnormalized FFT output, consistent with the reference solution. [cf. cite: 10] Normalization affects the absolute scale of the DFT.

5.  **Filter Definition (Problem 3):**
    * Corrected the definition of filter poles (`p`) and zeros (`z`) to accurately reflect the transfer function <span class="math-inline">H\(z\)</span> given in the assignment, including all complex conjugate pairs and real poles. [cf. cite: 5, 11, 12]
    * The original code incorrectly defined the poles/zeros (missing conjugates, using a repeated pole not specified, incorrect imaginary part for one zero). [cf. cite: 59, 60, 61, 62, 66, 67]

6.  **Code Structure and Best Practices:**
    * Used vectorized operations for signal generation, consistent with the reference solution.
    * Ensured plots included appropriate titles, labels, and axis limits (e.g., plotting frequency responses up to the Nyquist frequency <span class="math-inline">F\_s/2</span>). [cf. cite: 7]
    * Added comments clarifying the purpose of code sections and the rationale behind corrections.
